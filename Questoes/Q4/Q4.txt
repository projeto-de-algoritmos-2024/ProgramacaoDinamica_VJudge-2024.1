Problem Statement

Takahashi is standing at the coordinate

0 on a number line.

He will now perform
N jumps. In the i-th jump (1≤i≤N), he moves ai​ or

bi​ in the positive direction.

Is it possible for him to be at the coordinate
X after

N jumps?
Constraints

1≤N≤100
1≤ai​<bi​≤100(1≤i≤N)

    1≤X≤10000
    All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N 

X

a1​ 

b1​

⋮

aN​ 

bN​

Output

If it is possible for Takahashi to be at the coordinate
X after

N jumps, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample Output 1
Copy

Yes

By moving
b1​(=6) in the first jump and a2​(=4) in the second jump, he can be at the coordinate

X(=10).

Sample Output 2
Copy

No

He can be at the coordinate

X(=10) after the first jump, but not after all jumps.
